        <h1>A 2D SVG "Path" constructor</h1>
        <p>
            Without using any external libraries, create a 2D "Path" constructor in JavaScript that 
            accepts either an array of points (which are arrays themselves of length two) or a subset 
            of an SVG path string (see http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/paths.html), where only the 
            moveto, closepath and lineto commands are accepted. The path must be connected, so the 
            moveto command must only appear at the beginning and the closepath may optionally 
            appear only at the end. The lineto must accept both absolute and relative integer 
            coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Path objects must inherit from Arrays, so all array methods should work on Path
            objects. This means that new Path instanceof Path and new Path instanceof Array must both 
            return true. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A Path object must have a clone method that returns a new Path with the same points and 
            a toString method that returns an SVG path string representing the Path. Additionally, the 
            methods map, filter, and slice must return Path objects rather than pure arrays. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This implementation only needs to function in the latest versions of Firefox and Safari.
        </p>
